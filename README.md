## Hello ðŸŒ»

I am Ioanna and I am a back-end developer, heavily interested in Machine Learning and Mathematics, while constantly looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge level in multiple fields.

I am also interested in reading books on psychology, studying foreign languages and cultures, poetry and dancing.
