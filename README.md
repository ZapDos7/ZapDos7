## Hello ðŸŒ»

I am Ioanna and I am an junior developer. I specialize in software and web development, and I am heavily interested in Machine Learning and Mathematics, while constantly looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge level in multiple fields.

I am also interested in reading books on psychology, studying foreign languages and cultures, poetry and dancing.
