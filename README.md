## Hello ðŸŒ»

Hello, world!
I'm Ioanna, a Back-End Developer with over 4 years of experience, specializing in Java and frameworks like Spring Boot.

Iâ€™m passionate about problem-solving and enjoy developing efficient solutions to complex challenges. With a keen interest in AI, machine learning, and mathematics, Iâ€™m constantly seeking opportunities to deepen my knowledge and broaden my skills across various domains.

Iâ€™m inspired by leaders who lead by exampleâ€”those who manage both people and expectations with grace and authority. I especially admire women excelling in STEM fields and aspire to follow in their footsteps by thriving in similar roles.

Beyond tech, Iâ€™m deeply interested in psychology, foreign languages and cultures, as well as poetry and dancing.
